  "text": "Task: Summarize the following newsletter article in exactly one sentence that captures its core message.\n\nExplanation: You are summarizing for industry professionals who need a fast, high-level understanding of the article. Your summary should include the key topic, any notable findings or updates, and the article’s main implication or takeaway.\n\nLimitations:\n\nDo not exceed one sentence.\nDo not use bullet points or lists.\nDo not add commentary, opinion, or context not present in the original article.\nUse clear, informative language appropriate for a professional audience.\n\nInput Article:\nThe fine follows the conviction of former RBS trader, Shirlina Tsang, for fraud last year.\nShe was sentenced to 50 months in prison after being caught falsifying records of emerging markets trades.\nHong Kong regulators said RBS's controls were \"seriously inadequate\".\nThe Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) also said there were \"significant weaknesses in its procedures, management systems and internal controls.\"\nBut the regulator said the fine took into account the bank's speedy action in alerting the authorities once it had discovered the illegal trades, which took place in its emerging markets rates business in 2011.\n\"This deserves substantial credit and is the reason why today's sanctions are not heavier ones,\" Mark Steward, the SFC's head of enforcement, said in a statement.\nRBS responded with a statement, reading: \"We put in place a comprehensive remediation programme that strengthened our governance and supervisory oversight, and our control environment.\"\nThe fine is relatively small compared to others the bank has received in the last few years.\nIn December RBS agreed to pay 391m euros (£320m) in penalties to the European Commission for its role in the attempted rigging of Yen Libor and Euribor - the Tokyo and euro equivalents of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.\nIn the same month it was fined $100m (£60m) by US regulators for violations of US sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Burma, and Cuba.\nThe bank was found to have removed location information on payments made to US financial institutions from countries such as Iran and Cuba.",
