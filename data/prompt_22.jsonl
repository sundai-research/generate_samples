I've pictured crossing that line first and winning the Olympics and to finally be here and do it, it's just surreal. It's a culmination of four years of hard work.\"\nSwimmer Jazz Carlin, rower Victoria Thornley and rugby sevens players Sam Cross and James Davies had already enjoyed podium finishes before Doull secured Wales' seventh gold in the last three Olympics.\nWales had not won an Olympic title in 36 years when Nicole Cooke stormed to women's road race gold in 2008 - the first Welsh cycling medal ever at an Olympics.\nBut since Cooke's win in Beijing, Wales have won three more cycling gold medals - and could win a fifth on Saturday when Elinor Barker will help the British world record holding women bid for team pursuit gold.\nDoull - who started cycling at the Maindy Fliers club in Cardiff like Thomas and Barker - had helped the Great Britain team to lower the world record in their heat demolition of New Zealand.\nBut Team GB were quickly behind in Friday's final as Australia led by 0.7 seconds at the halfway mark, before GB reeled them in and then pulled away in the final 500m to win the 4km race by 0.83 seconds - in a world record time of three minutes, 50.265 seconds.\nDoull's team-mate Wiggins became the first Briton to win eight Olympic medals - five golds, one silver and two bronzes - as GB won a third successive team pursuit Olympic title.\n\"It gives you such confidence....you've got Brad on my right behind me and I've got Burke and Ed down below me,\" said Doull.\n\"It's Burke's second Olympic title in his discipline, it's Ed's third and he's the most decorated Yorkshireman, so he keeps telling me, so to have that calibre of team is just massive and it gives you such confidence.\"",
