  "text": "Task: Summarize the following newsletter article in exactly one sentence that captures its core message.\n\nExplanation: You are summarizing for industry professionals who need a fast, high-level understanding of the article. Your summary should include the key topic, any notable findings or updates, and the articleâ€™s main implication or takeaway.\n\nLimitations:\n\nDo not exceed one sentence.\nDo not use bullet points or lists.\nDo not add commentary, opinion, or context not present in the original article.\nUse clear, informative language appropriate for a professional audience.\n\nInput Article:\nIt is believed to be the first alleged breach of the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPim).\nThe suspect appeared at the Old Bailey accused of failing to contact a monitoring company and report to a police station twice in January.\nThe Home Office has refused to comment on the case.\nTPims replaced control orders in January 2012.\nThe suspect - who can only be referred to as BM - was one of nine British citizens subject to a TPim when the figures were last disclosed in March.\nThe BBC is not aware of anyone else who has appeared in court charged with a breach of a TPim.\nThe Home Office said: \"We do not comment on individual cases.  The police investigate all breaches of TPims and will prosecute where that is viable.\"\nThose subject to a TPim can be ordered to stay overnight at a specified address and report to a police station every day.\nOther measures include a ban on contacting particular individuals, going to certain areas and places and travelling abroad.\nLabour has argued that TPims have \"weakened\" public protection against terrorism.\nIn March, the independent reviewer of terror laws, David Anderson, said TPims could prove less effective than control orders because they can be imposed for a maximum period of two years only.\nThe court heard that BM is charged with two counts of breaching Section 23 of a TPim order.\nThe allegations are that on 16 January he failed to contact a monitoring company, and on 27 January failed to report to a police station.\nBM, who has a grey beard and was dressed for the hearing in a white shirt, cannot be named nor have his address published for legal reasons.\nThe prosecutor Louise Gray asked for a provisional date of 2 July to be set for a plea and case management hearing.\nThe defendant was granted unconditional bail although he remains subject to the restrictions imposed by his TPim.\nA trial date was not set.",
  "truth": "A suspected terrorist has been charged with breaching conditions imposed as part of the government's new terror monitoring powers."
