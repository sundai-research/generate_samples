  "text": "Task: Summarize the following newsletter article in exactly one sentence that captures its core message.\n\nExplanation: You are summarizing for industry professionals who need a fast, high-level understanding of the article. Your summary should include the key topic, any notable findings or updates, and the articleâ€™s main implication or takeaway.\n\nLimitations:\n\nDo not exceed one sentence.\nDo not use bullet points or lists.\nDo not add commentary, opinion, or context not present in the original article.\nUse clear, informative language appropriate for a professional audience.\n\nInput Article:\nRestoring the function of the organ - which helps control blood sugar levels - reversed symptoms of diabetes in animal experiments.\nThe study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body.\nExperts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease.\nThe experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\".\nWhen people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet.\nIt resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day.\nThen they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine.\nPrevious research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing.\nBut animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell.\nThese are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high.\nDr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\"\nThere were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments.\nType 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin.\nFurther tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects.\nDr Longo said: \"Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes.\n\"Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations.\"\nBBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo.\nHe said: \"During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg (4.4-8.8lbs).\n\"But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight.\n\"But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly.\"\nHis blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers.\nHe said: \"The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat\"\nPeter Bowes: Fasting for science\nPeter Bowes: Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body\nSeparate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels. The latest findings help to explain why.\nHowever, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet.\nHe told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\"\nHe said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance.\nDr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes.\n\"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\"\nFollow James on Twitter.",
  "truth": "The pancreas can be triggered to regenerate itself through a type of fasting diet, say US researchers."
