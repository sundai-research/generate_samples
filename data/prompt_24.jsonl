When we heard that we could actually get married there it was a no-brainer.\"\nThe couple got married at the top of Easy Gully in a ceremony officiated by Halde Pottinger from the Humanist Society of Scotland.\n\"He was totally up for marrying us on skis and did an amazing job. He is currently trying to establish whether or not we are the first wedding actually conducted and vowed in skis - officiate and couple,\" said the Reids.\n\"We can't actually believe we are but there can't be many. We also managed to twist the arm of adventure photographer Hamish Frost, who came along to take photographs.\"\nThe couple added: \"The day could not have been better. Without doubt it was the best conditions of the year - with blue skies and fresh snow, we could not have asked for more.\"\nThey thanked the staff of Nevis Range for \"a fabulous job making our day possible\", and for helping in throwing \"a hell of a good party\" in the evening.",
